## Overview

Welcome to the "Heap Insert" project, an amateur-level exploration guided by Alexa Orrico, Software Engineer at Holberton School. This project focuses on implementing a Max Binary Heap using C programming language. The primary goal is to create functions that allow the insertion of nodes into the heap while maintaining the Max Heap ordering.

## Project Structure

- **0-binary_tree_node.c**: This file contains the implementation of a function that creates a binary tree node.
- **1-heap_insert.c**: Here, you'll find the function responsible for inserting a value into the Max Binary Heap.
- **\*-main.c**: A sample main file for testing the heap insertion functionality. Feel free to use it for testing your code.

## Requirements

- Editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Compilation: All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic.
- Style: Code should follow the Betty style, checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl.
- Structure: No more than 5 functions per file.
- Global Variables: Avoid using global variables.
- Libraries: You are allowed to use the standard library.
- Header File: Prototypes of all functions should be included in the header file named `binary_trees.h`.
- Header File Guard: Include guards should be present in all header files.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the `heap_insert` directory.
3. Review and implement the required functions in the respective C files.
4. Compile and test your code using the provided main files.

## Example Usage

```bash
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic binary_tree_print.c 1-main.c 1-heap_insert.c 0-binary_tree_node.c -o heap_insert```
./heap_insert
