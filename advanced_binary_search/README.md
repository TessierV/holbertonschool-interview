# Advanced Binary Search

# Overview
This project implements an advanced binary search algorithm in C. The advanced_binary function searches for a value in a sorted array of integers and returns the index where the value is located. The algorithm uses recursion to perform the search efficiently.

## Files
- ```search_algos.h ```: Header file containing the function prototype for advanced_binary.
- ```0-advanced_binary.c``` : Source file containing the implementation of the advanced_binary function.
- ```0-main.c``` : Main file used for testing the advanced_binary function.

## Compilation
Compile the 0-advanced_binary.c file with the following flags:
``` gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic 0-main.c 0-advanced_binary.c -o 0-advanced_binary ```
