# Pascal's Triangle - Project Overview


## Overview
This project involves creating a Python function called pascal_triangle(n) that generates Pascal's Triangle up to the n-th row. Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array of binomial coefficients, where each row represents the coefficients of the binomial expansion. The triangle starts with a single 1 at the top, and each subsequent row is generated by adding the two numbers directly above each element in the previous row.
