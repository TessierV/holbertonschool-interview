# Island Perimeter

## Description
This project contains a function island_perimeter(grid) that calculates and returns the perimeter of an island described by a grid. The grid is represented as a list of lists of integers where:

0 represents water
1 represents land

## Features
Each cell in the grid is a square with a side length of 1.
Cells are connected horizontally or vertically but not diagonally.
The grid is rectangular and its dimensions do not exceed 100x100.
The grid is completely surrounded by water.
There is only one island in the grid and the island does not have any lakes (internal water that isn't connected to the surrounding water).
