## Requirements

General
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
All your files should end with a new line
The first line of all your files should be exactly ``#!/usr/bin/python3``
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
Your code should be documented
Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.x)
All your files must be executable
<br><br>

## 1 - Lockboxes

### Resume :
You have n number of locked boxes in front of you. Each box is numbered sequentially from 0 to n - 1 and each box may contain keys to the other boxes.
Write a method that determines if all the boxes can be opened. (python)
<br><br>

## 2- insert_in_sorted_linked_list

### Resume :
Write a function in C that inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list.
<br><br>

## 3- heap_insert

### Resume :
Welcome to the "Heap Insert" project, an amateur-level exploration guided by Alexa Orrico, Software Engineer at Holberton School. This project focuses on implementing a Max Binary Heap using C programming language. The primary goal is to create functions that allow the insertion of nodes into the heap while maintaining the Max Heap ordering.
<br><br>

## 4- minimum_operation

### Resume :
In this exercise, the goal is to calculate the fewest number of operations needed to obtain exactly n occurrences of the character 'H' in a text file. The text editor can perform only two operations: Copy All and Paste. The challenge is to be efficient in utilizing these operations to achieve the desired count of 'H'.
<br><br>

## 5- Sandpiles

### Resume :
The "Sandpiles" project aims to implement a C function to add two sandpiles (3x3 grids). Each element of the grid represents the number of sand grains in that cell. Adding the sandpiles must be done according to specific rules, and the final result should be a stable sandpile.
<br><br>

## 6- Linked list cycle

### Resume :
The project involves developing a function in the C language to detect the presence of a cycle in a singly linked list. The check_cycle function takes a pointer to the beginning of the list as input and returns 0 if the list has no cycle, and 1 if a cycle is detected.
<br><br>

## 7- Palindrome integer

### Resume:
This project focuses on creating a C program that checks whether a given unsigned integer is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a number that remains the same when its digits are reversed.
<br><br>

## 8- UTF - 8 validation

### Resume :
This project focuses on implementing a method, validUTF8, that determines whether a given data set represents a valid UTF-8 encoding. UTF-8 is a character encoding capable of representing all possible characters, or code points, in Unicode. The goal is to validate whether a sequence of bytes, represented as a list of integers, adheres to the rules of UTF-8 encoding.
<br><br>

## 9- 2048 (single line)

### Resume :
This project implements the mechanics of the 2048 game for a single horizontal line. The goal is to be able to slide and merge numbers on this line in either left or right directions. Identical numbers, if contiguous or separated by zeros, should be merged.
<br><br>

## 10- Menger sponge

### Resume :
This program draws a 2D representation of the Menger sponge based on the provided level. It uses the '#' character to represent filled blocks and space character (' ') to represent empty space.
<br><br>

## 11- nqueens

### Resume :
The N Queens problem is the challenge of placing N non-attacking queens on an NÃ—N chessboard. This program provides a solution to the N Queens problem using backtracking algorithm.
