## Requirements

General
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files should end with a new line
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
Your code should be documented
All your files must be executable
<br>

## 1 - Lockboxes

### Resume :
You have n number of locked boxes in front of you. Each box is numbered sequentially from 0 to n - 1 and each box may contain keys to the other boxes.
Write a method that determines if all the boxes can be opened. (python)
<br><br>

## 2- insert_in_sorted_linked_list

### Resume :
Write a function in C that inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list.
<br><br>

## 3- heap_insert

### Resume :
Welcome to the "Heap Insert" project, an amateur-level exploration guided by Alexa Orrico, Software Engineer at Holberton School. This project focuses on implementing a Max Binary Heap using C programming language. The primary goal is to create functions that allow the insertion of nodes into the heap while maintaining the Max Heap ordering.
<br><br>

## 4- minimum_operation

### Resume :
In this exercise, the goal is to calculate the fewest number of operations needed to obtain exactly n occurrences of the character 'H' in a text file. The text editor can perform only two operations: Copy All and Paste. The challenge is to be efficient in utilizing these operations to achieve the desired count of 'H'.
<br><br>

## 5- Sandpiles

### Resume :
The "Sandpiles" project aims to implement a C function to add two sandpiles (3x3 grids). Each element of the grid represents the number of sand grains in that cell. Adding the sandpiles must be done according to specific rules, and the final result should be a stable sandpile.
<br><br>

## 6- Linked list cycle

### Resume :
The project involves developing a function in the C language to detect the presence of a cycle in a singly linked list. The check_cycle function takes a pointer to the beginning of the list as input and returns 0 if the list has no cycle, and 1 if a cycle is detected.
<br><br>

## 7- Palindrome integer

### Resume:
This project focuses on creating a C program that checks whether a given unsigned integer is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a number that remains the same when its digits are reversed.
<br><br>

## 8- UTF - 8 validation

### Resume :
This project focuses on implementing a method, validUTF8, that determines whether a given data set represents a valid UTF-8 encoding. UTF-8 is a character encoding capable of representing all possible characters, or code points, in Unicode. The goal is to validate whether a sequence of bytes, represented as a list of integers, adheres to the rules of UTF-8 encoding.
<br><br>

## 9- 2048 (single line)

### Resume :
This project implements the mechanics of the 2048 game for a single horizontal line. The goal is to be able to slide and merge numbers on this line in either left or right directions. Identical numbers, if contiguous or separated by zeros, should be merged.
<br><br>

## 10- Menger sponge

### Resume :
This program draws a 2D representation of the Menger sponge based on the provided level. It uses the '#' character to represent filled blocks and space character (' ') to represent empty space.
<br><br>

## 11- nqueens

### Resume :
The N Queens problem is the challenge of placing N non-attacking queens on an NÃ—N chessboard. This program provides a solution to the N Queens problem using backtracking algorithm.
<br><br>

## 12- Array to AVL

### Resume :
The task presented here, "Array to AVL", requires writing a function that constructs an AVL (Adelson-Velsky and Landis) tree from a sorted array of integers. The AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree where the heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one. The function takes an array of integers and its size as input and returns a pointer to the root node of the constructed AVL tree.
<br><br>

## 13- Linear Search in Skip List

### Resume :
This program implements a linear search algorithm in a skip list data structure. The skip list is a linked list with an "express lane" that allows for faster searching of elements.
<br><br>

## 14- Star Wars API - Amateur

## Resume :
This project is a Command Line Interface (CLI) application that utilizes the Star Wars API to display characters from a specific film. The Star Wars API provides data about films, characters, planets, spaceships, and much more from the Star Wars universe.

The goal of this project is to create a Node.js script that takes the ID of a Star Wars film as input and displays the names of the characters appearing in that film.
<br><br>

## 15- Rain Based on Walls

## Resume :
This Python script calculates the amount of water retained after it rains, based on a given list of non-negative integers representing walls of width 1.
<br><br>

## 16- Heap Sort

## Resume :
Heap Sort is a sorting algorithm that works by transforming an array into a data structure called a heap, then repeatedly extracting the root element of the heap (which is the maximum in the case of a max heap or the minimum in the case of a min heap) and rebuilding the heap. Here's an outline of the algorithm
<br><br>

## 17- Advanced Binary Search

# Resume :
This project implements an advanced binary search algorithm in C. The advanced_binary function searches for a value in a sorted array of integers and returns the index where the value is located. The algorithm uses recursion to perform the search efficiently.
<br><br>

# 18- Count it!

## Resume :
This project involves creating a recursive function that queries the Reddit API, parses the titles of all hot articles, and prints a sorted count of given keywords (case-insensitive, delimited by spaces). For example, "Javascript" should count as "javascript", but "java" should not count as "javascript".
<br><br>

## 19 - Infinite Multiplication

## Resume :
This project contains a C program that multiplies two positive numbers provided as command-line arguments.
