Star Wars API - Amateur

## Overview
This project is a Command Line Interface (CLI) application that utilizes the Star Wars API to display characters from a specific film. The Star Wars API provides data about films, characters, planets, spaceships, and much more from the Star Wars universe.

The goal of this project is to create a Node.js script that takes the ID of a Star Wars film as input and displays the names of the characters appearing in that film.

## Features
Displays characters from a Star Wars film based on its ID.
Uses the Star Wars API to fetch data about films and characters.
Utilizes the request module to perform HTTP requests.

## Usage
To use this script, execute 0-starwars_characters.js while specifying the ID of the Star Wars film as an argument. For example, to display characters from the film "Return of the Jedi" (ID = 3):

bash
```./0-starwars_characters.js 3```
